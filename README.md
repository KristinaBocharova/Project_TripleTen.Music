# **TripleTen.Music**  

## **Project Description:**  
This project analyzes the music preferences of residents in two cities — Springfield and Shelbyville. The primary goal is to test three hypotheses based on real user listening data.  

## **Hypotheses:**  
1. User activity varies depending on the day of the week and differs between cities.  
2. On Monday mornings and Friday evenings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres.  
3. Pop music is more popular in Springfield, while rap is more popular in Shelbyville.  

## **Dataset:**  
- `userID` — user identifier  
- `Track` — track title  
- `artist` — artist name  
- `genre` — music genre  
- `City` — user's city  
- `time` — exact time the track was played  
- `Day` — day of the week  

## **Tools Used:**  
- Python (pandas)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

## **Key Findings:**  
✅ **The first hypothesis is confirmed.**  
⚠️ **The second hypothesis is partially rejected** due to the high similarity between the cities.
❌ **The third hypothesis is rejected.**
